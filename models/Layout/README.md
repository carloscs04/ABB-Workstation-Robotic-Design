## 🎯 Design Objectives  
- **Accurate Representation**: Models follow real-world industrial standards.  
- **Modular Approach**: Components are designed for flexibility and reusability.  
- **Simulation Ready**: CAD files are structured for use in robotic simulations.  

## 🔧 File Formats  
- **SolidWorks (.SLDPRT, .SLDASM)** – Native CAD models  
- **STEP/IGES (.STEP, .IGES)** – For compatibility with other CAD software  
- **PDF/DXF (.PDF, .DXF)** – For 2D documentation and layouts  

## 🛠️ Tools Used  
- **SolidWorks** – Primary CAD software for modeling and assemblies  
- **KeyShot** (Optional) – For rendering high-quality visuals  
- **AutoCAD** (Optional) – For detailed 2D layouts  

## ⚠️ Guidelines for Contribution  
- Follow **consistent naming conventions** for parts and assemblies.  
- Ensure all **dimensions** and **constraints** are properly defined.  
- When exporting, include a **PDF or STEP version** for cross-platform access.  
- Document any **changes** in the commit messages for version control.
